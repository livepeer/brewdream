# Brewdream - Realtime AI Video Summit

> **🤖 For AI Agents**:
> - Read [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md) first to understand **what to build** (product vision, requirements, acceptance criteria)
> - Then read [`VIBEME.md`](./VIBEME.md) to understand **how it's built** (current implementation, architecture patterns, coding conventions)
> - These documents are tightly integrated - PRD is the source of truth for features, VIBEME is the source of truth for code patterns
